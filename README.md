Cross-game porting system for Mass Effect Trilogy games

This is a WIP generic version of CrossGen-V - the system used to port Pinnacle Station from ME1 to LE1.

It currently uses a lot of hardcoded paths, so you probably won't make too much use out of it without a bit more cleanup of the code, which will happen someday, maybe.
